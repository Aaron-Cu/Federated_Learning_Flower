    "Welcome to the next part of the federated learning tutorial. In previous parts of this tutorial, we introduced federated learning with PyTorch and Flower ([part 1](https://flower.dev/docs/tutorial/Flower-1-Intro-to-FL-PyTorch.html)).\n",

If you see an error related to GPU availability in one of the following sections, consider switching back to CPU-based execution by setting `DEVICE = torch.device(\"cpu\")`. If the runtime has GPU acceleration enabled, you should see the output `Training on cuda`, otherwise it'll say `Training on cpu`."
